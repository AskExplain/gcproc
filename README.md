# Generalised Canonical Procrustes
A generative encoding method - ideas stemming from the geometric Procrustes, the statistical Canonical Correlation Analysis, and the neural network Autoencoder.

A method that aligns multiple datasets of various matrix size via an encoding into a lower dimensional space. 

By learning the encoding structure of the data, can also predict and impute missing values.
